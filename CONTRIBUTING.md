# Contributing to Skill Exchange Hub

We love contributions from the community! By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please check the existing Issues first. If the bug hasn't been reported, open a new Issue and include:

* A clear, descriptive title.
* The exact steps to reproduce the bug.
* The expected behavior vs. the actual behavior.
* Screenshots or log output if relevant.

## ✨ Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome ideas for new features or improvements. Open an Issue with the label **"enhancement"** and clearly describe:

* The goal of the enhancement.
* The proposed solution (if you have one).
* Why this change would benefit the project.

## 💻 Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Fork** the repository and clone it locally.
2. **Create a new branch** for your feature or fix (e.g., `feature/add-dark-mode` or `fix/login-bug`).
3. **Make your changes.** Ensure your code adheres to any existing coding standards.
4. **Write clear, descriptive commit messages.** (e.g., `feat: Add skill search functionality`).
5. **Test your changes** thoroughly.
6. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)** to the `main` branch. In the PR description, reference any related Issues (e.g., `Closes #123`).

## ✍️ Code Style

While we don't enforce a strict formatter, please aim for **consistency** with the existing codebase. If your contribution involves a new language or significant change, follow these general guidelines:

* Use **meaningful variable and function names**.
* Add **comments** where the code logic is complex.
* Keep functions and methods **concise** and focused on a single task.
